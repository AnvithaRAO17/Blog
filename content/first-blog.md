## Hey this is my first website
Application security in cyber security is the practice of protecting web applications and software from unauthorized access and malicious cyber attacks.
### Importance of security
Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a type of security testing that is designed to identify vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. The goal of penetration testing is to simulate a real-world attack on the system in order to identify any weaknesses that could be exploited by a malicious attacker.
